# Reacting to React Project

This project was created with the intention to learn React Basics.

Additionally, it has been littered with bugs and is intended to allow you to:
1. Read error messages to track down the error at hand.
2. Follow the general structure of a React project that includes the npm packages axios and react-router-dom.
3. See / Learn how to use the react-router-dom package to navigate between pages.
4. See / Learn how to use the axios package to make API calls.
5. See / Learn how to read and write to the local storage.
6. See / Learn how to debug another developer's project. 

There are various kinds of mistakes made throughout the app. 
1. The first problem is going to involve the index.js file. 
2. The second problem is going to involve the App.js file. Once you get past those two files the error messages will help guide you to the rest of the app.
